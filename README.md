Small python app that allows you to get some info from facebook .json message files

I made it mostly for fun and learning. It is my first app. In theory it should work fine with most languages, but I am not sure.

It:
  -Merges all the message files for simplicity's sake
  -Fixes encoding in merged one
  -Allows you to :
    -check how much specified word/sentence occured in your conversation
    -check how much time you spent on call
    -show you how much messages you exchanged
    
If you have any suggestions feel free to write them, right now I am thinking about:
  -checking how much times specified word/sentence occured in ALL conversations, not only in one
  -checking how much time specified person used specified word/sentence
  -doing some graphs with mathplotlib
